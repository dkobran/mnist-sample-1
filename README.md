# MNIST in TensorFlow

This repository demonstrates using Paperspace Gradient to train and deploy a deep learning model to recognize handwritten characters, which is a canonical sample problem in machine learning.

We build a convolutional neural network to classify the [MNIST
dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) using the
[tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data),
[tf.estimator.Estimator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator),
and
[tf.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers)
APIs.
